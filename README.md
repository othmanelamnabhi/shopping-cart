# Javascript Simplified: Shopping Cart

On this project from the [Javascript Simplified](https://javascriptsimplified.com) course, I got to make a fully functional cart.
* The cart icon and cart list of items only appear when they're not empty
* They persist across refreshes
* When you add an item already present in the cart, a multiplier shows up
